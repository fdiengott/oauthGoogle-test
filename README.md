# oauth-test

I followed [this tutorial](https://annotate.dev/p/hello-world/learn-oauth-2-0-by-building-your-own-oauth-client-U2HaZNtvQojn4F) for this project to better understand oauth, which is something I don't (yet) have much experience.

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
